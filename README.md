This is some code to extract and save frames from videos, and integrated with Streamlit. The main one, that works with Streamlit, supports both uploaded videos and YouTube videos via link. The one that runs locally only does YouTube videos and lacks functionality.

This is something I quickly vibe coded to help with another project, so don't expect it to be perfect.
